\## Phase 3: API Development \& Containerization



\### Overview

This folder contains the FastAPI application for serving ML model predictions, input validation schemas, and Docker containerization configurations.



\### Implementation Steps



\#### Step 1: FastAPI Application Setup

\- Initialize FastAPI application with proper project structure

\- Set up development environment with FastAPI and related dependencies

\- Create basic application configuration and settings management

\- Implement health check and status endpoints



\#### Step 2: Model Integration and Loading

\- Integrate with MLflow Model Registry to load production models

\- Implement model loading utilities with caching mechanisms

\- Create model inference pipeline with preprocessing steps

\- Set up model versioning and hot-swapping capabilities



\#### Step 3: API Endpoints and Validation

\- Develop `/predict` endpoint for housing price predictions

\- Implement Pydantic schemas for California Housing features validation

\- Create comprehensive input validation and error handling

\- Add API documentation with example requests and responses



\#### Step 4: Docker Containerization

\- Create optimized Dockerfile with multi-stage builds

\- Set up Docker Compose for local development and testing

\- Configure container health checks and resource limits

\- Implement proper logging and environment variable management



\#### Step 5: Container Registry and Deployment Prep

\- Set up Docker Hub repository for image storage

\- Create container build and push automation scripts

\- Implement container versioning and tagging strategies

\- Prepare deployment configurations for production environments

\### Integration Points



\#### From Previous Phase (Model Development):

\- Load registered models from MLflow Model Registry

\- Use model metadata for feature validation and preprocessing

\- Integrate with model training utilities for consistent data handling

\- Access model performance metrics for API response enhancement



\#### To Next Phase (CI/CD):

\- Provide Docker build configurations for automated builds

\- Share API testing endpoints and validation schemas

\- Ensure application is ready for automated deployment

\- Provide health check endpoints for deployment monitoring
