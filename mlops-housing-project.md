- Dockerized application
- Container pushed to registry

**Success Criteria**:
- API accepts JSON requests and returns predictions
- Input validation prevents invalid data
- Application runs consistently in containers

### Phase 4: CI/CD Pipeline Automation
**Goal**: Fully automated testing, building, and deployment

**Tools & Technologies**:
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD workflows
- pytest for automated testing
- Code linting (flake8, black)
- Automated Docker builds and deployments

**Key Deliverables**:
- CI pipeline with automated testing and linting
- CD pipeline with Docker build and push
- Deployment automation to AWS EC2/LocalStack
- Integration tests for API endpoints

**Success Criteria**:
- All tests pass automatically on commits
- Docker images built and pushed automatically
- Deployment happens without manual intervention

### Phase 5: Monitoring & Logging Infrastructure
**Goal**: Production monitoring and observability

**Tools & Technologies**:
- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Grafana for visualization and dashboards
- Python logging for application logs
- SQLite for lightweight log storage

**Key Deliverables**:
- Prometheus metrics collection setup
- Grafana dashboards for model performance
- Application logging for requests and predictions
- /metrics endpoint for monitoring

**Success Criteria**:
- Real-time metrics visible in Grafana
- All predictions and requests logged
- Alerts configured for system issues

### Phase 6: Advanced MLOps Features - Bonus
**Goal**: Enterprise-grade MLOps capabilities

**Tools & Technologies**:
- Automated model retraining pipelines
- Data drift detection algorithms
- A/B testing framework
- Advanced monitoring and alerting

**Key Deliverables**:
- Model retraining triggered by performance degradation
- Data drift detection and alerts
- A/B testing capability for model comparison
- Advanced monitoring dashboards

**Success Criteria**:
- Models automatically retrain when needed
- Data drift detected and flagged
- Multiple model versions can be tested in production

## System Architecture Overview

The system follows a microservices architecture with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Data Layer**: GitHub + DVC for version control
2. **Training Layer**: MLflow for experiment management  
3. **Serving Layer**: FastAPI + Docker for model serving
4. **Automation Layer**: GitHub Actions for CI/CD
5. **Monitoring Layer**: Prometheus + Grafana for observability
6. **Infrastructure Layer**: AWS EC2/LocalStack for deployment

## Technology Stack Recommendations

### Primary Stack (Recommended)
- **API Framework**: FastAPI (performance + documentation)
- **Data Versioning**: DVC (large dataset support)
- **Experiment Tracking**: MLflow (ML-specific features)
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana (industry standard)
- **Deployment**: AWS EC2 (production-ready)

### Alternative Stack (Budget-Conscious)
- **API Framework**: Flask (simpler, faster development)
- **Data Versioning**: Git LFS (smaller datasets)
- **Monitoring**: SQLite + Python logging (minimal setup)
- **Deployment**: Docker Compose (local/dev environments)
