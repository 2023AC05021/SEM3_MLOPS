\## Phase 2: Model Development \& Experiment Tracking



\### Overview

This folder contains all machine learning model development code, experiment tracking setup with MLflow, and model evaluation components for the housing price prediction task.



\### Implementation Steps



\#### Step 1: MLflow Setup and Configuration

\- Install and configure MLflow tracking server

\- Set up MLflow backend store (SQLite for local, PostgreSQL for production)

\- Configure artifact store for model and experiment artifacts

\- Create MLflow project configuration files



\#### Step 2: Model Development Environment

\- Set up development environment with required ML libraries

\- Create base model training framework with logging capabilities

\- Implement data loading utilities that integrate with Phase 1 data

\- Set up experiment configuration management



\#### Step 3: Model Implementation and Training

\- Implement Linear Regression model for baseline performance

\- Develop Decision Tree Regressor with hyperparameter tuning

\- Create model training scripts with MLflow experiment tracking

\- Implement cross-validation and performance evaluation metrics



\#### Step 4: Experiment Tracking and Model Comparison

\- Log model parameters, metrics, and artifacts to MLflow

\- Implement automated hyperparameter tuning with MLflow tracking

\- Create model comparison and evaluation frameworks

\- Set up experiment reproducibility with seed management



\#### Step 5: Model Registration and Selection

\- Register best performing models in MLflow Model Registry

\- Implement model staging workflow (Staging → Production)

\- Create model evaluation reports and performance summaries

\- Set up model versioning and metadata management
