## Phase 4: CI/CD Pipeline Automation



### Overview

This folder contains GitHub Actions workflows for continuous integration, continuous deployment, code quality checks, and automated testing pipelines.



### Implementation Steps



#### Step 1: CI Pipeline Setup

- Create GitHub Actions workflow for continuous integration

- Set up Python environment with dependency caching

- Configure code quality checks with Black and Flake8

- Implement automated linting and formatting validation



#### Step 2: Build Automation

- Create Docker image build automation workflow

- Set up multi-architecture builds for different deployment targets

- Implement build caching and optimization strategies (optional)

- Configure automated vulnerability scanning for containers (optional)

&nbsp;

#### Step 3: Deployment Pipeline

- Develop automated deployment workflow for EC2/LocalStack

- Create deployment scripts for different environments (dev/staging/prod)

- Implement blue-green deployment strategy for zero-downtime updates

- Set up deployment rollback mechanisms and health checks



#### Step 4: Integration with External Services

- Integrate with Docker Hub for automated image pushes

- Set up AWS credentials and deployment permissions

- Configure MLflow integration for model deployment tracking

- Implement notification systems for deployment status (optional)



#### Step 5: Pipeline Optimization and Monitoring

- Optimize pipeline execution times and resource usage (optional)

- Set up pipeline monitoring and failure alerting

- Create deployment analytics and reporting

- Implement automated rollback triggers based on health checks

```



### Integration Points



#### From Previous Phase (API Development):

- Use Dockerfile and docker-compose configurations from API folder

- Integrate with FastAPI health check endpoints for deployment validation

- Access container registry configurations for automated pushes

- Utilize API testing scripts for deployment verification



#### To Next Phase (Monitoring):

- Trigger monitoring setup after successful deployments

- Provide deployment metadata for monitoring dashboards

- Set up integration with Prometheus for deployment metrics

- Ensure monitoring services are configured during deployment

- Docker image build and registry push automation

- Deployment pipeline for multiple environments

- Automated health checks and rollback mechanisms

- Comprehensive deployment monitoring and alerting



### Dependencies

- GitHub Actions

- Docker Hub
