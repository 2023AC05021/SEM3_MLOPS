\## Phase 5: Monitoring \& Logging Infrastructure



\### Overview

This folder contains monitoring, logging, and observability components including Prometheus metrics collection, Grafana dashboards, and application logging configurations.



\### Implementation Steps



\#### Step 1: Prometheus Setup and Configuration

\- Install and configure Prometheus server for metrics collection

\- Set up Prometheus configuration files with scraping targets

\- Create custom metrics for ML model performance tracking

\- Implement service discovery for dynamic target configuration



\#### Step 2: Application Metrics Integration

\- Integrate Prometheus client libraries with FastAPI application

\- Create custom metrics for prediction latency, accuracy, and throughput

\- Implement model performance metrics and data drift detection

\- Set up infrastructure metrics collection (CPU, memory, disk, network)



\#### Step 3: Grafana Dashboard Development

\- Install and configure Grafana with Prometheus data source

\- Create comprehensive dashboards for system monitoring

\- Develop ML-specific dashboards for model performance tracking

\- Implement alerting rules and notification channels



\#### Step 4: Logging Infrastructure

\- Set up structured logging framework for application components

\- Configure log aggregation and storage using SQLite

\- Implement log rotation and retention policies (optional)

\- Create log analysis and search capabilities (optional)



\#### Step 5: Alerting and Notification System

\- Configure alerting rules for system and application metrics

\- Set up notification channels (email, Slack, PagerDuty)

\### Integration Points



\#### From Previous Phase (CI/CD):

\- Receive deployment notifications for monitoring updates

\- Access deployment metadata for service discovery

\- Integrate with deployment health checks for monitoring triggers

\- Use infrastructure configurations for monitoring setup



\#### To Next Phase: N/A (Final phase)



\### Additional Integration Points:

\- \*\*API Integration\*\*: Scrape metrics from FastAPI `/metrics` endpoint

\- \*\*Model Integration\*\*: Monitor MLflow model performance metrics

\- \*\*Infrastructure Integration\*\*: Monitor deployment targets and container health



\### Deliverables

\- Prometheus server with comprehensive metrics collection

\- Grafana dashboards for system and ML model monitoring

\- Structured logging system with search and analysis capabilities

\- Alerting system with notification and escalation procedures

\- Performance monitoring and anomaly detection for ML models
